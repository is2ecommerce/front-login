# Development Dockerfile for running the Angular dev server inside a container
# This mirrors running `ng serve` locally. Not intended for production.

FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies (including devDependencies needed by ng serve)
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy source files
COPY . .

# Expose the dev server port
EXPOSE 4200

# Use environment suited for development
ENV NODE_ENV=development

# Start the Angular dev server, listen on all interfaces so container port mapping works
